			<h1>WELCOME TO VFalator!!!</h1>
			<h2 className="warning-text">Warning: the enhancements made to this umalator fork enables usage of the tool as a more comprehensive race simulator, to simulate raw skill length differences without RNG factors <strong>set 'Position Keep' to 'Approximate'</strong> and <strong>turn off 'Wit Variance'</strong></h2>
			<p className="warning-text">Raw skill length comparisons, as per the original umalator, have been battle-tested on JP and remain largely accurate. New additions such as Wit Variance and Virtual Pacemaker are experimental and results with these features should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

				<summary>Caveats</summary>
				The simulator is fairly complete and implements nearly all relevant game mechanics, with the following exceptions:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Pseudo-random skills based on the location of other umas use a best-effort estimation for the distribution of their activation locations which may not be perfectly reflective of in-game behavior in all circumstances</summary>
							<p>Skills that have conditions that require you to be blocked, are based on other umas in your proximity, etc, are modeled according to statistical distributions intended to simulate their in-game behavior but may not be perfectly accurate. It should always find the correct minimum and maximum but the reported mean and median should sometimes be taken with a grain of salt. For example skills with blocked conditions are generally better in races with more umas and worse with fewer. Use your better judgement.</p>
							<p>Skills with conditions with <code>_random</code> in the name (e.g. <code>phase_random</code>, <code>corner_random</code>, <code>straight_random</code>) are implemented identically to the in-game logic and will have more accurate mean/median values, as are skills based purely on the course geometry with no blocked front/side/surrounded conditions.</p>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Skill cooldowns are not implemented</summary>
							Skills only ever activate once even if they have a cooldown like Professor of Curvature or Beeline Burst. 
						</details>
					</li>
					<li>
						<details>
							<summary>Unique skill scaling with levels is not implemented</summary>
							Unique skills are always simulated as a base level 3â˜… unique.
						</details>
					</li>
					
					<li>Motivation is always assumed to be maximum</li>
				</ul>
				By and large it should be highly accurate. It has been battle-tested on the JP server for several years. Please use this if you KNOW what the hell you are doing.
